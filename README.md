# Alzheimer Prediction Using ML Classification

This project aims to perform classification on a dataset to predict Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis based on various health and lifestyle factors. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes features such as age, gender, education level, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, and others.

## Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Categorical data was encoded for machine learning models.
- Modeling: Logistic Regression was used for classification.
- Evaluation: Model performance was assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Achieved an accuracy of 0.7.

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Model: Logistic Regression.
